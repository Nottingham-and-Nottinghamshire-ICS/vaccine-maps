# Vaccine uptake mapping report

This code produces maps of vaccine status and compiles them to a report. It was written by an individual who has since left the ICS, and the database code has been redacted for security purposes. The code will therefore not run out of the box, and it is not currently maintained (although this may change in the future).

We provide the code as an example in order to help others in the ICS and wider who may be doing a similar task
